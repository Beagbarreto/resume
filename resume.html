  <h1>Beatriz Ailed García Barreto Portfolio</h1>
  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>Hello, my name is Beatriz, aka Len (for audiovisual projects and performances)
  <p>I studied Communications Science focused on audiovisual media and arts in UVM. I studied music Technology in Juilliard School of Arts. Shortly after I took an add, 360° marketing and UX design workshop at School of Visual Arts.</p>
  <p>I am currently studying programming and work as a tour guide if there's time.</p>
  <h3>Why did I decide to take a class on programming?</h3>
  <p>Most of my professional background is related to web management and digital marketing (you can read more about it in my resume), this made me realized that having basic knowledge of how to make small changes in websites was not enough. I started to study at "hola-code" to learn how to make the changes required in sites to make them more userfriendly on my own.</p>
