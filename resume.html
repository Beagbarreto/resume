  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>Hello, my name is Beatriz, aka Len (for audiovisual projects and performances). I am interested in sound and technology and what they can do together.</p>
  <p>I studied Communications Science focused on audiovisual media and arts in UVM. I studied music Technology in Juilliard, School of Arts. Shortly after I took an add, marketing and UX design workshop in School of Visual Arts, NY.</p>
  <p>I am currently studying programming and work as a tour guide if there's time.</p>
  <h3>Why did I decide to take a class on programming?</h3>
  <p>Most of my professional background is related to web management, and digital marketing (you can read more about it in my <a href="#">resume</a>), this made me realized that having basic knowledge of how to make small changes in websites was not enough.
    I started to study at "hola-code" to learn how to make the changes required in sites to make them more userfriendly on my own.</p>
